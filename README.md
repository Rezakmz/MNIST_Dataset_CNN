# MNIST_Dataset_CNN
This project involves developing a CNN model for predicting the class of the clothing based on the input image.

__About Dataset__ <br>
__Context__<br>
MNIST is a subset of a larger set available from NIST (it's copied from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

__Content__<br>
The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. .
Four files are available:

train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz: training set images (9912422 bytes)
train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: training set labels (28881 bytes)
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz: test set images (1648877 bytes)
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: test set labels (4542 bytes)
